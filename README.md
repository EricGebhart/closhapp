# Closh and Liquid POC
Closhapp is an attempt to integrate [Liquid](https://github.com/mogenslund/liquid) with [Closh](https://github.com/dundalek/closh).

The state right now is to be considered EXPERIMENTAL.

It is supposed to be used in two ways.

1. As a standalone app for running Closh using Liquid as interface.
2. As an extension to Liquid to add Closh functionality for Liquid.

## Start as standalone
    clj -m closhapp.core
